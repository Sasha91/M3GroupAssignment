We wanted to create a proof of concept, where a neural network would predict the price class of used cars on craigslist. Due to the vast prepration needed for the dataset to the useable in a neural netowkr, the project is split into two notebooks. One for the for the preparation and one for the data exploration and network construction.

Furthermore, we have written a stakeholder report that explains the motivation, execution and reflection on the project in a less technical fashion, that is available on this repository.
